# Ember Chat

This is a demo app I created to help learn Ember JS.  It uses Sinatra for the server side and Twitter Bootstrap for styling.

# Remaining To Dos (without persistance)
- sort out createAt and date data types in Ember
- Display message with contact is lost with server
- send message to other clients when user logs in or leaves the chat and add a logged in window to display what users is logged in

- create Redis-powered branch
- create web sockets branch - https://github.com/simulacre/sinatra-websocket#readme
